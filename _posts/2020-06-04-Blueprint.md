## A Blueprint for Hong Kong on Strike

_There is no expectation that this pamphlet will cause a general strike – as such it sets no date for the general strike. It simply seeks to show what is required of workers and students for a successful lasting general strike; the task right now is to organise to meet those requirements._

In the face of the disastrous national security law that threatens to obliterate the Hong Kong movement, the only path forward is a **lasting** general strike by the masses of the Hong Kong working class. **GENERAL STRIKE OR THE END OF HONG KONG AS WE KNOW IT.**

The question now becomes one of **HOW**: how can we birth a general strike, how can it be sustained, and how can it end successfully?

This pamphlet will attempt to answer these questions.

### Birthing a General Strike:
A general strike cannot be begged into existence, especially in Hong Kong’s economic and cultural conditions. It can only be birthed from a foundation of coordinated organisations.

This coordination must come from two groups: the workers and students. These two must work in unity.

##### The Workers: 
Pro-democracy trade unions are the form of organisation for the workers. They must be the ones to call the general strike, and their membership must be the first to participate in it.

This is because, due to fear of punishment from employers and the Hong Kong government, the majority of workers with pro-democracy sympathies are unwilling to strike unless the general strike has enough momentum and many are already on strike. Pro-democracy unions are the only organisations that have the power to coordinate workers to strike simultaneously; and only they have a dedicated membership willing to risk punishment from going on strike.


##### The Students:
 Student unions, as well as informal student groups bonded by personal connection, are the form of organisation for the students. Though they cannot strike with the same economic power as workers, they are integral to aiding the strike by amplifying the efforts of pro-democracy unions. To do this they must be in constant communication with the pro-democracy trade unions.

During the initial phase of the strike students must be the publicising arm of the pro-democracy unions. They must flood the streets with propaganda, informing workers the details of the strike and convincing them to join.

The students must also intensely stall economic activity to contribute to the initial momentum of the general strike. By strategically obstructing movement through street protest and blocking transportation, they can affect economic activity by far more than their actual number.


### Sustaining a General Strike:
A general strike is ineffective if it is not lasting. Our enemies will not be afraid of a weapon that is dropped as fast as it is picked up. Again, organisations of workers and students play a key role for sustaining a general strike.

##### The Workers:
 If enough initial momentum is created, the general strike will begin to spread amongst the workers, both out of desire and necessity. Supportive workers, seeing the risks lowered, will form their own informal organisations and actively join the strike. Meanwhile neutral workers will be limited or prevented altogether from working if the industries they are dependent upon shut down.

As this occurs pro-democracy unions must show themselves capable of caring for the welfare of striking workers by redirecting essential industries to serve the general strike. Labour must continue in restaurants and crucial industries (e.g. health) so that food and essential services are available to the workers. This way the unions can appeal to and gain the support of neutral workers simply seeking to maintain their livelihood.

Pro-democracy unions must actively seek to recruit the masses of poorer workers who may be opposed to the general strike because of how it may damage their livelihood. Without these workers the general strike will be too small to succeed. Thus, these workers must given priority in terms of access to essential services. Furthermore, they must be shown that Democracy is aligned with their economic interest, that the National Security Law will only intensify the economic misery for the Hong Kong working class. ECONOMIC GOALS MUST BE RAISED WITH THE POLITICAL.


##### The Students: 
Student organisations must continue their propaganda efforts to maintain the morale of the workers. They must also aid pro-democracy unions in ensuring the welfare of all workers by transporting essential resources during the strike, especially to the poorest workers. 
 
Students must be disciplined in performing the jobs that pro-democracy unions are unable to perform to expand the strike. If certain sectors of the transportation industry refuse to join the pro-democracy unions, students must strategically occupy these sectors. Further, they must patrol the streets to ensure that shopkeepers hungry for profits keep their doors shut. Street protests with the sole aim of stalling economic activity must also continue.

Students must be prepared to defend the strike against the inevitable attempts by the Hong Kong government and 黑警 to force people back to work. If the strike is threatened by violence, the students will have to respond with violence.

The tasks in this stage of the strike are all too complex for scattered, uncoordinated organisations to undertake. Therefore, there must be progressively greater centralisation among trade unions and student unions; the previous tactics of spontaneous action are insufficient. At least a citywide mass trade union and student union must be created.


### Ending a General Strike:
A general strike, especially in Hong Kong’s conditions, cannot continue forever. The movement must bargain with the government while it lasts, promising to end the strike early for significant concessions, especially the repeal of the national security law.

The centralised pro-democracy unions must be the representative of the movement during this bargaining process. If they have absorbed a sufficient number of supportive, neutral, and originally opposed workers, they will be able to bargain with the full strength of the general strike behind them.

If the government stubbornly rejects the movement’s reasonable demands, the students must be prepared to escalate their activities, including by intensifying economic disruption and street protests.

The movement cannot gain a false sense of confidence upon the end of the general strike. It must continue strong towards democracy, using the experience and expanded organisations from the strike to prepare for new activities. Otherwise the government can easily and immediately take back any concessions won by the strike. Organisations are the foundation for the birth of the strike, and stronger organisations must in turn be born from the strike.

A well-executed general strike will not only defend Hong Kong, but also empower future advances for the Hong Kong movement.


### MAIN POINTS:
Birth of the Strike:
1.	Pro-democracy unions must call the general strike; their members must be the first to participate in it.
2.	Students must be an extension of pro-democracy unions. They must spread propaganda everywhere and protest solely to disrupt economic activity.

Sustaining a General Strike:
1.	A general strike is ineffective if it is not lasting. Our enemies will not be afraid of a weapon that is dropped as fast as it is picked up.
2.	Pro-democracy unions must redirect industries, such as food and health, to care for striking workers. They particularly must show that Democracy is in the economic interest of poorer workers to gain their integral support.
3.	Students must be prepared to defend the strike against violence from the Hong Kong government. They must also transport essential services to the workers.
4.	Organisations must centralize to hand the complex tasks.

Ending a General Strike:
1.	Pro-democracy unions must use the general strike while it lasts to bargain for significant concessions from the Hong Kong government, particularly the repeal of the national security law.
2.	The movement must use experience and expanded organization from the strike for future resistance of the CCP.
