## For A General Strike

***

### Our Situation, Precisely:
_Based on available information at time of writing (23/5)._

The Chinese Communist Party has recently introduced a resolution in its currently on-going annual National People’s Congress. This resolution, if passed, will grant the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress the power to craft and implement a national security law prohibiting “any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People’s Government [The Chinese Communist Party]” in Hong Kong in accordance with Article 23 of Basic Law. 

The National People’s Committee is expected to vote on the resolution on May 28th, next Thursday. A rubber stamp for Xi Jinping, they will likely agree to pass it if no major resistance domestically and internationally occurs.

If the resolution passes, it is unclear how soon after the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress could implement the national security law. However, the committee can theoretically vote and pass the law after just one reading (i.e. immediately) if the law is specific enough and opinion is unanimous.

If the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress follows through with imposing the national security law, they will be able to do so directly, through promulgation. Opposition or stalling through LegCo or the Hong Kong legal system will be impossible.

### The Stakes:
A national security law WILL doom Hong Kong. 

Hong Kong’s civil liberties, already trampled over by the 黑警(devil cops) and the Hong Kong government for almost a year, will meet their final demise with such a law. ‘National security’ in reality means the security of the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule. And to threaten the security of the Chinese Communist Party is not a difficult task: every act, even every thought, genuinely in favour of freedom and democracy is considered a threat to Party rule. 

Specifically, the national security law will, at least, _likely_ lead to…

1.	Democratic activists and Chinese dissidents in Hong Kong being arrested, or even ‘disappeared’, to face life imprisonment without trial.

2.	Democratic organisations, parties and activities in Hong Kong being banned.

3.	Journalists who report honestly on Mainland China being arrested, or intimidated into self-censorship.

4.	A chilling effect of self-censorship among all Hong Kong citizens out of fear of committing “subversion” against the CCP.

The national security law currently being planned is even worse for Hong Kong’s civil liberties than the one defeated in 2003. This time Mainland security services will be allowed to operate in Hong Kong with free legal reign to maintain ‘national security’, and a Mainland ‘National Security Agency’ will be established in HK.

As Hong Kong civil liberties are eroded, so too is its economic existence. Hong Kong’s status as Asia’s financial hub is based upon the security of its common law; if the national security law corrupts this, the financial sector will lose its viability in Hong Kong. Already the investor class is beginning to leave, as seen from the recent significant drops in the Hang Seng Index.

And finally, the Hong Kong movement for Democracy will be destroyed. Through existing authoritarian laws in Hong Kong the movement has already been severely weakened; it cannot survive the tyrannical powers provided by a national security law. None of us are safe.

### The Task:
Condemning the CCP and the Hong Kong government for this new violation is a natural response. But this is too easy, and teaches us nothing that we didn’t already know.

We need a lasting workers strike. And this can only come about by the movement uniting with the working class of Hong Kong.

We must face facts: almost a year of our usual protests has led to our current situation. Our efforts have only resulted in the Extradition Bill being replaced with something far worse. Our previous strategies have proven completely inadequate to the goal of Democracy, to the slogan 時代革命 (the revolution of our times).

The problem is not that we haven’t been dedicated enough – by God we have been dedicated. The problem is also not that we haven’t been violent enough – it is impossible for effective resistance to be solely dependent on military victory over the armed and well equipped HKPF, or worse the PLA. The problem is that we have failed to utilise the base of economic power in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong working class.

Only the economic hammer of a working class strike will break the Hong Kong government and CCP’s confidence that they can endlessly dominate Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government and the pro-Beijing tycoons they are allied with live off the labour of the working class for resources, taxes and profits. Without our work and income they have nothing, they are nothing.

Student protests, no matter how violent, are just mosquito bites. A general strike crushes tyranny at its economic foundation. Students can lead this movement, but workers must form the core. Chinese history, from the May 4th Movement to the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, demonstrates this.

Of course, a general strike is no easy task. The 5th August general strike only contained a fraction of the Hong Kong working class. But through its failure it has taught us the tasks we must meet to establish a general strike.

1.	The general strike must be actively organised through trade unions or similar associations. It cannot be begged into existence through propaganda. Organisation must also be extensive, with workers loyal to the call to strike and coordination between all pro-democracy unions.

2.	The Hong Kong working class must be shown that the general strike stands for their economic interest. Many poor workers are reasonably concerned about their livelihood, and so are afraid to go on strike for mere ‘ideals’ about Democracy. This has to change. We must show that Democracy stands with the poor of Hong Kong, against the Hong Kong government and the pro-Beijing tycoons exploitation of Hong Kong people, especially through their monopoly on land. 

This path, no matter how long and difficult it may be to travel down, is the only one that can truly resist the CCP. Experience has taught us that demonstrations and student protests are too weak; this national security law proves that the CCP cannot be effectively opposed any other way than by the mass of workers through a general strike.
