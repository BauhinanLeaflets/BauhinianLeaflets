Democracy in Hong Kong
The Hong Kong movement long ago raised its standard, and upon that standard is emblazoned but one word – Democracy. For the sake of this one word the masses have bore countless brutalities, and through pain and despair they still continue to proudly carry it forward. 

Evidently then, the movement’s determination for Democracy is not in short supply. But this merely poses an unavoidable question: what does it mean for the Hong Kong movement be true to its own standard of Democracy? Taking up the ideological task presented by this question – the task of clarifying Democracy for the movement – is integral if the movement is to succeed, or to even recognise what success entails.

The importance of this task is further intensified by the two ideological temptations that constantly threaten to poison the movement from the inside.

The first of these temptations is Dogmatism, which mutates Democracy into a dogmatic abstraction. Under Dogmatism, Democracy becomes the word of God, a principle that is advocated solely because of its transcendental ‘goodness’ – in reality merely one’s individual desire for Democracy – which is accepted and asserted uncritically. The movement begins to justify itself based on its ‘moral superiority’, while all critics are denounced as heretics whose opposition is solely a sign of moral failing. In essence, Democracy becomes a religion, such that faith, not reason, leads the movement.

The second temptation is that of Opportunism, which reduces Democracy to a disposable piece of propaganda. Under Opportunism, Democracy becomes shapeless and self-serving, its meaning transforming to whatever casts the movement as ‘Democracy’ or grants it popularity in any given time. At one moment, Democracy means ‘One Country Two Systems’; at another, it means Localism; at yet another, it means Socialism. Ultimately, the centrality of the goal of authentic Democracy for the movement is liquidated: instead of the movement serving Democracy, it is ‘Democracy’ that serves the movement.

Dogmatism and Opportunism, despite appearing opposites, are united in that they both abandon the task of seriously clarifying Democracy for the Hong Kong movement. If the movement succumbs to either temptation, it will undoubtedly prove inadequate to its own standard of Democracy, if not collapse completely under ideological impotence.

The Hong Kong movement must therefore critically establish the foundations of Democracy while avoiding these twin temptations. Further, it must do so by rediscovering the insights of the long intellectual tradition of Democracy, the thinkers who possessed the greatest clarity on the concept of Democracy.

It is thus that we return to Jean Jacques Rousseau, the first prophet of Democracy in the modern age. The foundation that Rousseau provides us – his fundamental discovery – is the necessity of Democracy for society to be free.

Rousseau declared that Democracy was the only legitimate form of government. He did not mean that all individuals necessarily desired Democracy, but that Democracy was the only form of government whose laws humanity can freely and justifiably follow out of obligation, rather than out of the threat of force or arbitrarily.

Rousseau pointed out that governments that rule by force merely compel the people by physical necessity to follow their laws. The people may thus follow laws out of submission, but no independent obligation to follow laws is created. Thus, such a government has no legitimacy outside of its might: as an entity whose only justification is its force, it can just as justifiably be overthrown by force. 
	
Furthermore, Rousseau dismissed the notion that governments could become legitimate through people voluntarily surrendering their individual natural liberty – the autonomy and independence that all men inherently possess in the absence of society – to their government. He argued that to sacrifice liberty to such a government is plainly against one’s own interest: in exchange for the sacrifice, such a government would only tax and exploit the individual. Therefore, giving up one’s liberty is a sign of madness, and so confers no legitimacy to a tyrannical government. 

Under these conditions however, it would seem that no government could possibly be genuinely legitimate. In all governments the law, to be effective, has to be imposed by force, and to follow laws we necessarily have to abandon our natural liberty of being able to do as we please. Yet, Rousseau proposed that Democracy could resolve these twin contradictions. This was because only Democracy had the potential of manifesting the General Will – the common will of the people. 

The reason why following the General Will ensures the legitimacy of Democracy was because it eliminated the distinction between government and the people. To be sure, in a Democracy the people would have to sacrifice their natural liberty to the laws. But, uniquely, in a Democracy the government would in exchange act out the General Will. Thus, the people would be sacrificing their natural liberty to laws that are the product of their collective will; their freedom is sacrificed to no one but themselves as a group. The people become obligated to follow laws because, instead of oppressive alien forces, laws become self-imposed instruments for the people’s common advantage. 

Through this discovery Rousseau placed the necessity for Democracy on a firm foundation. Democracy was revealed as fundamentally legitimate not because it satisfied some dogmatic individual preference, but because it was the only form of government that every human could freely and rationally be obligated to. Indeed, in Rousseau’s hands Democracy became a truly universally legitimate government, since it served the reasoned common interest of all of society.

The second foundation of Democracy that the Hong Kong movement must rediscover is that of requirements for Democracy beyond simply the right to vote. Alexis De Tocqueville notably stressed that voting in a Democracy alone did not ensure legitimacy, since the threat of a ‘tyranny of the majority’ dominating a defenseless majority remained a threat.

Indeed, for Rousseau himself a ‘tyranny of the majority’ was a major concern. As such, he distinguished the General Will from the mere will of the majority. While a Democracy acting in accordance with the General Will was legitimate, one acting in accordance with the will of the majority was not. This was because a government that acted in the will of the majority would impose laws that infringed on the liberties of the minority for no corresponding benefit, and therefore such laws could only be maintained by force. Of course, inevitably the votes of a majority would determine laws in a Democracy; however, such decisions were only legitimate insofar as the majority was likely to have identified the General Will。

From his concerns Tocqueville identified that in order for a Democracy to authentically function society must not only vote, but also manifest a Democratic spirit. Certain attitudes and behaviours must flourish among the people for the process and outcome of Democracy to be legitimate and just. These include an active engagement in civic life, widespread education, and control over immense un-meritocratic inequalities. Otherwise, “soft despotism” – a situation where the people, even with the right to vote, would be dominated or seek to dominate others due to prejudices or the influence of the powerful – could render the right to vote impotent in ensuring liberty.

The third foundation the Hong Kong movement must appreciate is the need to make Democracy appropriate for the industrial age. As the radical black scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued, the laws of an authentic Democracy cannot merely maintain civil liberties. Rather, a Democracy must extend to areas of life that most directly impact the people, namely to wages and the workplace. The General Will of the people includes the improvement of the financial livelihood and economic autonomy of the people; the economy must also come under Democracy. 

And so we return again to the ideological task: what does it mean for the Hong Kong movement to be true to its own standard of Democracy? Space forbids full treatment of it here, and it is a task that must constantly be returned to, and ultimately connected to practice, as long as the movement survives, but certainly the foundations of the thinkers of the past point to an answer that overcomes both Dogmatism and Opportunism.

Rousseau’s discovery shows that the Hong Kong movement’s standard of Democracy, as long as it remains authentic, is fundamentally legitimate. Further, he reveals that this is the case because Democracy represents the universal will of society, and so all society can be obligated towards it, rather than because of a dogmatic assertion of a individual desire for Democracy.

Yet, Rousseau also cautions us not to confuse authentic Democracy with mere majority rule. A Democracy is only legitimate insofar as it acts in accordance with the General Will, the common interest of society; as such the Hong Kong movement must seek to embody and establish the General Will if it truly wishes to be just. This is not merely a point about the abstract goals the movement must aim for; it has immediate bearing on the strategic success of the movement. Without embodying the General Will of all of Hong Kong society, the movement will correspondingly fail to gain the strength of society in its struggle. With enemies so overwhelming, our movement can only succeed with the full will of society behind it. 

Tocqueville represents how Democracy cannot be limited to the mere transformation of a system of voting. Democracy only legitimately functions insofar as the people embody Democratic values and seek to advance the General Will. The Hong Kong movement therefore cannot limits itself to solely the implementation of universal suffrage; like the New Culture Movement so long ago the Hong Kong movement must take up the task of educating citizens into Democracy. Conservative attitudes, including a valuing of order as an end in itself, born through Confucianism not only harm our movement in the present but also any potential Democracy in Hong Kong

Finally, Du Bois points to how the Hong Kong movement must expand the demand for Democracy outside the realm of civil liberties and into the workplace. The General Will cannot tolerate one-in-five people living in poverty, nor the host of other socioeconomic issues Hong Kong is afflicted with. Democracy does not stop at the parliament, but must be applied to all of society. In turn, having embodied their interests the movement can expect the support of the working class of Hong Kong, necessary in the modern age to crush any form of tyranny.
